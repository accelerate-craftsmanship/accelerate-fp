# Exercise: Lots of assignments

Rewrite the imperative Java function `peopleResidences()`
into something that:

- does not use re-assignment
- does not use mutable variables, specifically no mutable collections
- use immutable collections from `vavr.io` instead of the standard `java.util` mutable collections.

Tip:

- use [Vavr List](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.vavr/vavr/1.0.0-alpha-4/io/vavr/collection/List.html)
