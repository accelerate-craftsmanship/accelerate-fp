# Higher order function exercises

Higher order functions are functions that take functions as arguments or functions that return a function.

## ShoppingCart

This assignment represents a simple shopping cart that supports applying a discount.

The sales team always finds ways to comes up with inventive discounts, so the discount function has been separated from
the main shopping cart logic.

Implement all the missing discount related functions and make all the tests
in [ShoppingCart.test.ts](../../../../src/test/ts/ex_higher_order/ShoppingCart.test.ts) pass. Hint: look for `TODO`
in [ShoppingCart.ts](ShoppingCart.ts).
