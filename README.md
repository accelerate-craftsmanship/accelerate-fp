# Accelerate - Functional Programming

This repo acts as a starter for the hands-on workshop.

## Get ready!

Before the workshop starts, complete the following pre-requisites so that you can make a rolling start during the workshop.

TLDR: Install **IntelliJ Community Edition, Java 17 and Node 18**

## Install IntelliJ & Java 17

- Download and install the [Community Edition of IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- You can then [use IntelliJ to download Java 17](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tips/download-jdk/).

## Install Node 18

There are many ways to get Node installed. Choose whichever way works best for you.

- You can download a [Node 18 Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Or you can [use NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update), this project has a `.nvmrc` file, so if you have nvm you only have to run the `nvm -i` command in this folder.

## Download dependencies

Now you should be able to open this folder in IntelliJ. It should automatically recognize the Java Maven project and download any dependencies.

For the Node dependecies, you have to open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Check if tests run
